# oreo-code
A code to use if you ever need secret, yet delicious messages!

# Usage:
Go to the website `https://wolfdreamyt.github.io/oreo-code/` and go to the section where you can type. If you are on mobile, then you can type using the on-screen keyboard i made for mobile. If you are on PC/Mac/Linux you can go ahead and type using your physical keyboard like normally. You will see at the top translated to oreo language (so a mix of "Or" and "Re". Each combination has its own letter/number, acting like a whole language!

# how to translate back to english?
You can type in the code you got from your friend/user. This will automatically translate it back to the original format: english. The converted to english format is the most bottom section, usually at the bottom. **If there is a typo in the code it will not work, so make sure no typos are present.**
